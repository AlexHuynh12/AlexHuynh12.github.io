# Hello World

Hello! My name is ALex HUynh and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science

## Computer Science Projects

My Github page is [AlexHuynh12](https://github.com/alexhuynh12).

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 11 Part 1](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-11-huynh-and-ridog).
  
   This particular lab I favored because it had to work with real world numbers such as population, state name, land area, and land density. All of these
 things I worked with and even entered a file and worked with their numbers were fun as well. 
 
* [Lab 8 Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-alex-huynh-and-kira-g).
  
   This code was fun to do because it had to deal with needing to type in error messages and secret messages as well as the file names. I also got to work 
 with std::getline and learned a lot about coding. 
  
* [Lab 2 Part 1](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-AlexHuynh12).

   This lab was my favorite not because it was easy but because it was marked as my first ever code that I have done and I think this can be said to 
 everyone with them having std::cout Hello world as their first ever code.
