    ### CPSC 120

    * Lab 8 part 3

        This is my favorite because I got to learn to use return statements whether they were true or not and opened files to see whether they were accessible or not or if they are unable to be open, they we would print an error message. 

    * Lab 11 Part 2

        This is also my favorite because I had fun making if statements and counting down from the number of guesses. Using different files and returning to different things besides 1 or 0 were fun. 

    * Lab 2 part 1

        This is the best lab. Not because it was the easiest but it marked my first ever code that I have ever done. Looking back, I am impressed on how much I have learned and how much I can improve even more from how I wrote my first ever code.
